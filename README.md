Hi, i'm Martin Majewsky
=================================

I'm a passionate Backend and mobile developer student with a keen interest in UX/UI design for the betterment of well-established systems. I'm especially interested in my own growth as a programmer and the improvement of my abilities as a professional. I am open to any opportunity to lead any project to ensure the utmost quality.

I also like to toy around with mobile app ideas to make efficient things a little more efficient and easy.
